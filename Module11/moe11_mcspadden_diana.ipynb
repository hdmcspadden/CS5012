    "## Shared Resource Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The shared resource is the **laundry hamper**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5 humans are depositing items of dirty laundry in the hamper\n",
    "* The hamper holds 100 items of dirty laundry, although the hamper can get crammed with up to 105 items. A warning message is displayed if the ha,per has over 99 items (for this toy problem, if the hamper is full, the humans must just keep wearing dirty clothes).\n",
    "* Laundry loads are only performed when there are 20 items of dirty laundry, and a load only cleans 20 items of dirty laundry.\n",
    "* There are never negative numbers of dirty laundry items.\n",
    "* While there are **5** humans creating dirty laundry, there is only **1** washing machine to clean the laundry. But the washing machine can be run several times a day (days and times are simulated with time.sleep())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* My toy problem lets the humans add a random number of dirty items between 1 and 10 dirty items\n",
    "* And, while ideally, a full laundry load has exactly 20 items and the condition is only met when more than 20 items are available for a load, I allow some \"human\" error and laundry loads clean a random number of items between 18 and 20.\n",
    "* And, ideally, the full hamper could only hold 100 items, it can hold up to 102 items (and more may be piled on because of random number of dirty items that can be created by the \"people\") and gives a warning if the number of items is over 99.\n"
